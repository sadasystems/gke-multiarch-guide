To build the docs you must have the following installed:

- [m4](https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/)
- [gh-md-toc](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc)
- [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip) (not required but helps preview changes)

With that installed you should be able to run

```
bash ./scripts/build_docs.sh
```
